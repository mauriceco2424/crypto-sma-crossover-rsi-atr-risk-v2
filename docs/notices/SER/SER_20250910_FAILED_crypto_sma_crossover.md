# Strategy Evaluation Report (SER)
## Run ID: crypto_sma_crossover_20250910_153318

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: **FAILED - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ERROR**  
**Severity**: P0 (Critical)  
**Evaluator**: Single-Evaluator (Enhanced Validation Framework)

---

## Executive Summary

**EVALUATION HALTED**: Critical accounting discrepancy detected during mandatory visual validation. The backtest shows a declining equity curve (from $10,000 to $9,246, -7.54% return) while metrics.json reports a positive +6.21% return. This 13.75 percentage point discrepancy represents a fundamental accounting failure that invalidates all results.

## Validation Results

### 1. Mandatory Visual Validation ✅ PERFORMED
- **Result**: Clear equity decline from $10,000 to ~$9,246 observed
- **Peak Equity**: $10,684 
- **Maximum Drawdown**: -19.5%
- **Visual Return**: -7.54% (NEGATIVE)

### 2. Halt Condition ⚠️ TRIGGERED
- **Condition**: "If visual equity declines but metrics show positive returns → STOP immediately"
- **Status**: CONDITION MET - Immediate halt executed
- **Visual Shows**: -7.54% decline
- **Metrics Report**: +6.21% gain
- **Action**: Pipeline halted, escalation to Builder initiated

### 3. Accounting Reconciliation ❌ FAILED
- **Initial Capital**: $10,000
- **Reported Return**: +6.21%
- **Expected Final Equity**: $10,621
- **Actual Final Equity** (series.csv): $9,246
- **Discrepancy**: $1,375 (13.75% error)
- **Tolerance**: 1% maximum
- **Result**: FAILED - 13.75% >> 1% tolerance

### 4. Open Position Disclosure ⚠️ WARNING
- **Open Positions at Period End**: 5
- **Unrealized Exposure**: Significant (exact value requires investigation)
- **Impact**: May contribute to accounting discrepancy

## Root Cause Analysis

The backtest engine exhibits a critical accounting failure where:

1. **Return Calculation Error**: The total return calculation appears inverted or fundamentally broken
2. **Equity Tracking Disconnect**: Metrics module is not properly synchronized with actual equity tracking
3. **Open Position Handling**: Unrealized P&L from 5 open positions may be incorrectly accounted

## Critical Findings

1. **Visual-Numerical Inconsistency**: 13.75 percentage point discrepancy between visual and reported returns
2. **Accounting Identity Violation**: Final equity reconciliation fails by $1,375
3. **Direction Inversion**: Metrics report gains while equity clearly declines
4. **Data Consistency Failure**: series.csv confirms visual observation, contradicting metrics.json

## Escalation & Required Actions

### Immediate Actions (P0 - Critical):
1. **HALT** all backtest executions immediately
2. **QUARANTINE** this run's data as unreliable
3. **NOTIFY** Builder of critical accounting failure

### Builder Investigation Required:
1. Debug metrics calculation in `scripts/engine/backtest.py`
2. Verify total return formula implementation
3. Audit open position mark-to-market logic
4. Check for sign inversions in return calculations

### Framework Enhancements Needed:
1. Implement automatic visual-numerical consistency checks
2. Add unit tests for all return calculation scenarios
3. Enforce accounting identity validation in all runs
4. Add pre-flight checks for metrics consistency

## Validation Framework Assessment

**✅ FRAMEWORK SUCCESS**: The enhanced validation framework performed exactly as designed:
- Correctly prioritized visual validation
- Detected critical discrepancy immediately
- Triggered appropriate halt condition
- Prevented false-positive results from propagating

This validation test has proven the framework's effectiveness in catching critical accounting errors.

## Recommendation

**DO NOT PROCEED** with any backtests until the accounting error is resolved. This is a fundamental engine failure that invalidates all results. The strategy itself cannot be evaluated until the engine produces consistent, reliable metrics.
